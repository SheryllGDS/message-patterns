Subject: Incomplete application - Appeal to Tax Tribunal

To: {user email address}



Dear {user name}

On {date saved} you saved an application to appeal to the Tax Tribunal.

This is to remind you that you still haven't completed your application. You have until {application deadline date} to complete and submit it.

We won't be able to review and make a decision on your appeal if you don't complete your application on time. If you miss the deadline but still want to apply, you'll have to start again.

Get back to your saved application {link to application}.

If you want to cancel your application, just let the deadline pass. We'll close the application for you.

Thanks

Tax Tribunal team
