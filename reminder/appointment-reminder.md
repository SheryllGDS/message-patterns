## Appointment reminder email pattern

From: Appeal to the tax tribunal

Subject: Application incomplete - Appeal to Tax Tribunal

To: ((email address))

Dear ((user name))

On ((date saved)) you saved an application to appeal to the Tax Tribunal.

We're emailing to remind you that you still haven't completed your application. 

You have until ((application deadline date)) to complete and submit it.

We won't be able to review and make a decision on your appeal if you don't complete your application on time. If you miss the deadline but still want to apply, you'll have to start again.

Get back to your saved application ((link to application)).

### Cancel your application

If you don't want to continue with your application, just let the deadline pass. We'll close your application afterwards.

Thanks

Tax Tribunal team
