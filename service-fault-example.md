Subject: Network down: Government Actuary’s Department

Dear John

There’s a problem with the Government Actuary’s Department (GAD) network. This means you won’t be able to log in to the network. 

We’re working to fix this as quickly as possible. We’ll update you every hour until the problem’s fixed.

Thanks for your patience.
